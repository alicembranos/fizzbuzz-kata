# FizzBuzz Kata Game in PHP
This project serves as an exercise to guide you through your initial steps in TDD.

## Goal
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
 - For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number.
 - For the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
 - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## Purpose
The primary aim of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the initial steps of TDD. Ensure you follow the three main phases of TDD:

- Red: First, write a failing test for each iteration.
  Green: Next, implement the solution for the iteration.
  Refactoring: Finally, refactor the code, making sure your tests still pass.

Remember to take it in "baby steps."
